Count the number of 1 bits in a number using only bitwise operations with Brian Kernighanâ€™s Algorithm.
Runtime complexity O(m), where m is only the number of set bits.

int countSetBits(int n) {
    unsigned int count = 0;
    while (n) {
        n &= (n-1);
        count++;
    }
    return count;
}
